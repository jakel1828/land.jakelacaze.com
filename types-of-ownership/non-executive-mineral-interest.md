# Non-executive mineral interest (NEMI)

A non-executive mineral interest (NEMI) entitles an owner to receive lease bonus
and royalties from production but does **not** entitle the owner to negotiate
and execute oil and gas leases or other agreements related to mineral ownership.

The owner of the [executive mineral interest](/land/types-of-ownership/executive-mineral-interest)
negotiates and executes a lease on behalf of the non-executive mineral interest owner.
The executive owner does not negotiate separate terms for the NEMI owner.
The NEMI owner is subject to the same terms and provisions agreed to in
the executive owner's lease.
